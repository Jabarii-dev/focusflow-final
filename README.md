# FocusFlow

FocusFlow is a behavior-driven productivity system designed to help people overcome procrastination, overwhelm, and digital distraction. Instead of relying on willpower or rigid planning, FocusFlow analyzes real user behavior, breaks large tasks into actionable micro-steps, and makes the cost of distraction visible in real time.

---

## Problem

Most productivity tools focus on task management rather than behavior. Users know what they need to do, but still struggle to start, stay focused, and finish tasks. Distraction is invisible, large tasks feel overwhelming, and feedback arrives too late to change behavior.

---

## Solution

FocusFlow treats productivity as a behavioral problem rather than a motivation problem. By tracking live user activity and responding instantly, it reduces friction, encourages momentum, and makes focus measurable and sustainable.

---

## Core Features

### Procrastination Analyzer

Tracks real user behavior to identify distraction patterns and peak distraction periods. It highlights top distraction sources, measures streak impact, and recommends personalized interventions to reduce context switching and attention drift.

### AI Task Decomposer

Transforms large or intimidating tasks into small, actionable focus sessions. Users can immediately start working with built-in timers and automatic step progression, eliminating planning paralysis and lowering the barrier to action.

### Distraction Cost Calculator

Converts lost focus time into visible cost metrics. It shows daily and annual projections, including the impact of context switching, making distraction tangible and behavior change more likely.
